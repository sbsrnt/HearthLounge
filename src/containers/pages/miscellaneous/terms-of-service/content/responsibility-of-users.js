      <p>
        If you upload or submit any user generated content ("Content") such as a deck, a deck comment, or guide, or otherwise
        make (or allow any third party or third party application to make) material available to the Service, you are
        entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless
        of what form or media the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, structured
        and unstructured data formats, or code. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that your Content and
        conduct do not violate these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting a deck (the "Deck") to HearthLounge, through use of the deck creation tool, direct use of our APIs
        or any other method, you grant HearthLounge a world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual and non-exclusive license to
        reproduce, analyze, modify, adapt, publish, redistribute and sell the Deck. Subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy,
        this license allows HearthLounge to publish the Deck on the website or on third party websites, use the Deck for
        promotional purposes, gather and publish analytics based on data gathered in the Deck. HearthLounge commits itself to be
        transparent about such uses of data, as they are described in our privacy policy. If you delete Content, HearthLounge
        will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the
        Content may not be made immediately unavailable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, HearthLounge has the right (though not the obligation) to,
        in HearthLounge's sole discretion,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity (reclaimed username will be changed to e-mail you have provided during registration)
        </li>
        <li>
          remove or permanently delete any or all of your Decks and Content with or without notice for any reason or no reason
        </li>
        <li>
          refuse or remove any Content that, in HearthLounge's sole discretion, violates any HearthLounge policy or is
          in any way harmful or objectionable
        </li>
        <li>
          terminate or deny access to the Service to any individual or entity for any reason or no reason
        </li>
      </ul>
